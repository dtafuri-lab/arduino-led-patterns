## 🔧 Hardware

- Arduino board (Uno/Nano)
- 14 LEDs + 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## 🔌 Wiring

Connect each LED: Pin → LED → Resistor → Ground
- LED 0-13 → Pins 0-13

## 🎨 Features

- **16+ unique patterns** with smooth transitions
- **Color sequences** building to white center  
- **Symmetrical designs** using pins 1-10
- **Modular code** - easy to customize

## 🚀 Usage

1. Wire LEDs to pins 0-13
2. Upload `led_design.ino` to Arduino
3. Enjoy the light show!

## ⚙️ Customization

- Change `delay()` values for different speeds
- Comment/uncomment patterns in `loop()`
- Add new patterns by creating `blink_X()` functions
